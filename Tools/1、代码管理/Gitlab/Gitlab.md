# Gitlab

(新工作的一天，从Gitlab开始)
（之前做手机OS，都是用Gerrit + Git做代码管理，其中code review主要是Gerrit，现在用Gitlab 来管理一个android aosp的大库，虽说不是很习惯，但是该做的事情还是要做啊。）

（学习一下）

## Gitlab 介绍

GitLab is a Git-based platform that integrates a great number of essential tools for software development and deployment, and project management:

+ Track proposals for new implementations, bug reports, and feedback with a
fully featured Issue Tracker
+ Organize and prioritize with Issue Boards
+ `Code review in Merge Requests with live-preview changes per
branch with Review Apps`
+ Build, test and deploy with built-in Continuous Integration
+ Deploy your personal and professional static websites with GitLab Pages
+ Integrate with Docker with GitLab Container Registry
+ Track the development lifecycle with GitLab Cycle Analytics
